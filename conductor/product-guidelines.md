# Product Guidelines: AI-Powered Document Assistant

## 1. Tone and Voice
The product's tone should be professional, reliable, and clear. While the underlying technology is complex, the user-facing language must be straightforward and supportive.

*   **Be Professional:** Use clear, industry-standard terminology where appropriate, but avoid jargon that may confuse non-technical users.
*   **Be Reliable:** The language should instill confidence. The system is an intelligent assistant, and the tone should reflect its capability and accuracy.
*   **Be Clear and Concise:** Instructions, labels, and feedback should be unambiguous and easy to understand.

## 2. Visual Identity
*   **Logo and Branding:** To be defined. Initially, use a clean and modern aesthetic.
*   **Color Palette:** Primary colors should be professional and muted (e.g., blues, grays), with brighter colors used sparingly for accents, calls to action, and status indicators (e.g., green for success, red for error).
*   **Typography:** Use a clean, legible sans-serif font for all UI elements and documentation.

## 3. User Experience (UX) Principles
*   **Efficiency First:** The primary goal is to save the user time and effort. Workflows should be streamlined and require the minimum number of clicks.
*   **Clarity and Feedback:** The user should always understand what the system is doing. Provide clear status indicators for processes like data extraction and document generation.
*   **User in Control:** While the system automates heavily, the user should always have the final say. Provide clear opportunities for review, manual overrides, and modification of generated content.

## 4. Prose Style for Documentation and UI
*   **Active Voice:** Use the active voice to make instructions clearer (e.g., "Upload a PDF" instead of "A PDF should be uploaded").
*   **Simple Language:** Avoid overly complex sentences.
*   **Consistency:** Use consistent terminology throughout the application and its documentation (e.g., always use "GOA Document," not "Offer" or "Arrangement").

## 5. Accessibility
*   Ensure sufficient color contrast.
*   Provide alternative text for all images and icons.
*   Ensure the application is navigable via keyboard.
